# ðŸ‘‘ AdventOfCode 2020 - Nim Edition ðŸ‘‘
Hello and welcome to my solutions for Advent of Code in Nim.

This is my first time participating and i'm using it as a chance to familiarize myself with Nim.

Take care and have fun!

## How to run
1. Install Nim [by clicking this link.](https://nim-lang.org/install.html)
2. Execute `nim c -r --hints:off <nim file>` on the directory of the day you want.
   - For example to run day 1 you go into the `day01` directory and execute `nim c -r --hints:off day01.nim`
